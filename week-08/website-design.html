          Continue to work on your website project by creating a web page with
          two sections, a
          <strong>development guide</strong> and a
          <strong>design guide</strong>.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Site Directory Structure</strong> - List the names of the
              folders and subfolders that will be included in your site. Include
              at least an <em><strong>images</strong></em> folder, and a
              <em><strong>css</strong></em> or
              <em><strong>styles</strong></em> folder. Include other folders
              appropriate to your website.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Main Navigation</strong> - Create a navigational flow
              chart or outline, showing each unique page of the site and how
              they are linked together.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>HTML Template</strong> - Build an HTML template for your
              site that includes self-documenting HTML sections for the main
              elements of your site. Your template should at least include an
              identity section, a navigation section, and a content section. Add
              the HTML necessary to define your main navigation
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Wire Frame - </strong> Inside your week-8 folder, create a
              folder called <em>wireframe.</em> Using your HTML template, build
              web page for each of the navigation sections of your site. The
              pages should be un-styled: black and white, with text headers and
              navigation links, but linked together. Clicking on any link should
              display another one of the pages in your wireframe which give the
              name of the section and lists the topics that will be included in
              that section of the site when complete.

              <strong>Layout or Storyboard </strong> – A visual reference that
              shows the general layout of the site. This is usually done with
              pen and paper first, then mocked up with a tool like
              <a href="https://balsamiq.com" target="_blank">Balsamiq</a> or
              <a href="https://moqups.com" target="_blank">Moqups</a> or
              <a href="https://pencil.evolus.vn" target="_blank">Pencil</a> or
              Photoshop. For this project, you may do just the pen and paper
              version. (Feel free to experiment with Photoshop if you have
              time.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Color Palette</strong> - A table showing the color palette
              appropriate to your site's personality that you plan to use to
              create the site. For each color, provide the hex value, the color
              chip and a color name. Your site color palette should include at
              least five different colors, not counting white and black.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Style Guide </strong>– An initial list of style rules -
              not necessarily the styles themselves - just which styles you
              anticipate needing. You can add to this later as necessary.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Media Assets </strong>– List any media files that you
              might want to use - along with information about these files
              including where the originals are located and licensing
              information. Typically, media files might include digital photos,
              graphics, music, video, and flash files - For this project you
              will most likely only have images and graphics.
