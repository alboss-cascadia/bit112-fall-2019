          Since I'm suggesting but not requiring the Git setup in the Visual
          Code editor, that means not everyone will be using it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The changes in folder structure from week 4 forward might be a bit
          confusing to people, so here is a picture of what that should look
          like.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            style="float: right; margin: 20px; border: 1px solid #666;"
            src="images/site-structure.png"
            alt="Folder structure for BIT 112 files"
          />
        </p>
        <p>At the very top of your site, there will be:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>an index.html file,</li>
          <li>a styles folder,</li>
          <li>and an images folder.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are my files, so don't panic if you don't have an exact match.
          Depending on when you look at this, there might be things in this
          image that you don't have. For example, in week 6 we will add a
          nav.html file and a scripts folder, and from week 7 onward we might be
          adding more things on the top levels as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the top level, there will be a folder for every week. Your
          weeks-1-3 will be in one folder, but after that there will be separate
          folders for week-04, week-05, week-06 etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each week folder will start with a copy of the previous week's work.
          Each week folder will have at least:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>index.html file</li>
          <li>about-me.html file</li>
          <li>styles folder with style.css</li>
          <li>images folder</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you are using Visual Code and Git, keeping GitHub in sync with your
          class files on your computer should take just a couple clicks and
          typing in a description.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are using GitHub through a web browser, go to your repository
          and click "Upload files." Then drag all the files and folders in your
          web project folder into GitHub via your web browser. Here's a picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's simplest to just drag everything. GitHub will sort out which
          files have changed and which are exactly the same, so you don't need
          to worry about that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following picture shows how it should look if you are adding to
          GitHub.com via a web browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            style="clear: right; width: 100%;"
            src="images/github-browser-commit.png"
            alt="Add files to GitHub from your web browser. 1. Select all the files and folders that are in your main folder. 2. Drag the files and folders into the GitHub upload window. 3. Add a commit message to describe the changes. 4. Click the 'Commit Changes' button"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Your main page in GitHub should now have the same contents as the
          folders and files on your computer. The topmost index.html and all the
          folders for all the weeks, as well as the root style and images and
          other folders.
        </p>
        <p>
          I should be able to go to your main index.html page and follow links
          to each week's lab assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
          As always, if any of this isn't clear, please tell me what's not
          obvious so I can fix it. Thanks!
