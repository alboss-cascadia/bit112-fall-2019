        <p></p>
        <p>
          For your work, the testing process will have two parts: HTML/CSS
          Validation and a Quality Assurance (QA) review. Complete the
          validation process on your own site, and complete the QA review of
          other students' sites. (They'll be assigned to you automatically as
          people turn them in for review this week.)
        </p>

        <p>
          HTML validation errors related to google fonts can safely be ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML/CSS validation uses a computerized checklist to carefully test
          the structure of a webpage and report errors. The official W3C
          validator is online at
          <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank"
            >http://validator.w3.org/</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The Web Developer browser extension/toolbar also has a W3 validation
          menu option built into it, and most of the browser developer tools and
          consoles flag validation errors.
        </p>

        <p>
          Validate all the pages in your site, and make any changes required to
          make your pages compliant with the HTML/CSS standards.
          <strong>Note:</strong> you should have been doing this all along, so
          if you have been following instructions all along, then this isn't
          going to be a very big task.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Quality Assurance (QA) review is another important part of testing a
          site. The process evaluates basic functionality, spelling, grammar,
          browser compatability, and clarity, along with making sure the overall
          presentation fits the tone of the site. QA Testing also makes a list
          of known errors and issues needing correction. We will be using
          GitHub's <em>Issues</em> function to list those for the sites you
          review.

        <ol>
          <li>Log into GitHub.</li>
          <li>
            On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository you're
            reviewing.
          </li>
          <li>Under the repository name, click Issues.</li>
          <li>
            Click New issue.
            <ul>
              <li>

                  repository, click </em
                >Get started<em>
                  next to the type of issue you'd like to open. That only
                  happens if the repo owner has created templates for different
                  issue types. Most of the time in this class, that's not going
                  to happen, and GitHub will just open a new issue automatically
                  for you.</em
