      <h1>GitHub and the Visual Studio Code editor</h1>
    </header>

        <p>
          It's time we used these tools a little more efficiently, by connecting
          the code editor directly to GitHub. If you're using an editor that
          isn't Visual Studio Code, the instructions will differ, but the
          concepts will be the same.
        </p>

        <h2>Setup (one-time)</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Go to
              <a href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank"
                >https://git-scm.com</a
              >, download and install Git on your computer.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Upload all your working files, regardless of what awful condition
              they might be in, to your GitHub repository.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Go to your repo in GitHub.com. Copy the URL from the browser
              address bar. It will be structured like this:
            </p>

            <p>https://github.com/alboss-cascadia/bit112-fall-2019</p>

            <p>
              It starts with https://github.com/ <br />
              Then it has your github login<br />
              then it has the name of your repo
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Copy that URL. (Yours, not mine.)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Go to Visual Studio Code.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Just to make sure it's a clean start, go to File, New Window.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Click View, Command Palette.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In the field that pops up, type in git and click on Git: Clone
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Paste in the URL.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              It will ask you where you want to put the repository.
              <strong
                >Don't put it inside the folders you have been working on for
                this class, or you will wind up with a copy inside the
                original.</strong
              >
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Click File, Save Workspace As, give it a name, and save it.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>From now on</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              On the sidebar in Visual Studio Code, you should notice the third
              icon down (three circles connected by 2 lines). That's the GitHub
              icon. It probably has a number next to it, to show you have
              changes that aren't in Git.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Click that icon. It will show all the files you've changed.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              There's a little field at the top that says
              <strong>Message</strong>. This is where you type in what you have
              changed. For this one you can just type <i>Setup</i> since that's
              what you're doing. Normally you'd by typing something like
              <i>New navigation formatting</i> or
              <i>Fixed typo on title tag.</i>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              After you put in the message, click the checkmark just above the
              message box. If it says
              <i
                >There are no staged changes to commit. Would you like to
                automatically stage all your changes and commit them
                directly?</i
              >
              just click Yes.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In VS Code, in the bottom left of the window, there should be the
              little git icon (three circles connected by 2 lines) and the word
              <i>Master</i>, and next to that there's an icon. It's probably two
              arrows forming a circle, although it could be a cloud. Click that.
            </p>

            <p>
              If it asks you for your GitHub username and password, enter them
              in the box when asked.
            </p>

            <p>
              This will add your changes to GitHub.com and update your github.io
              website.
            </p>
