        <p>
          Once your folder structure starts getting complicated and we start
          using includes, we have a new problem that will affect people who are
          doing fancy stuff like reusing the include link from multiple folders.
          A link that works from one folder might not work from a subfolder.
        </p>
        <p>
          If that's not a problem you are having, then that's fine. It's mostly
          going to be a problem for people who are going beyond the minimums
          described in the lab instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it's a problem you are having, the solution is start every
          hyperlink with a / like this:
        </p>
        <pre>&lt;a href="/week-04/index.html"&gt;Week 4&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
        <p>
          That slash says, "from the site root, go to..." Now the navigation
          should work no matter what folder it's in, and you should only need
          the one file.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Important! Important! Important!</strong> That slash is the
          <strong>root</strong> of your website.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If your website is
              <em>https://alboss-cascadia.github.io/</em> then
              <strong
                ><span style="font-family: courier, 'courier new', monospace;"
                  >/week-04/index.html</span
                ></strong
              >
              will open
              <em>https://alboss-cascadia.github.io/week-04/index.html</em>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              However, if your website is
              <em
                >https://alboss-cascadia.github.io/<span style="color: red;"
                  >bit112-fall-2019/</span
                ></em
              >
              then you need to use
              <strong
                ><span style="font-family: courier, 'courier new', monospace;"
                  >/bit112-fall-2019/week-04/index.html</span
                ></strong
              >
              to get from the site root to the right place.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Be sure to put that same / here:</p>
        <pre>&lt;script src="/scripts/includes.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
        <p>
          (using the same important important important comment about site root
          as above).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want it to use the main CSS and not something in a week folder,
          change it here:
        </p>
        <pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/styles/style.css" /&gt;</pre
        >
        <p>
          (still using the same important important important comment about site
          root as above).
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Great, Al, you broke my pages</h3>
        <p>
          When you start a link with a slash, that is shorthand for
          <em>From the server root, go to..</em>. That works fine when the files
          are on <em>github.io</em> but you won't be able to browse them or see
          the CSS on your computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people are fine putting everything into GitHub to see how it
          looks. If that's you, great!
        </p>
        <p>
          Other people want to see how it looks without having to upload to
          GitHub all the time. The solution is to install a Web server on your
          computer. There are lots of complicated ways to do this, but the
          simplest way is to use a free product that does all the complicated
          stuff for you. There are plenty of these. I'm suggesting MAMP because
          it's free and it works on both Windows and Mac OS.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Note that we are not turning your computer into a web server on the
            Internet.</em
          >
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Go to
              <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                >https://www.mamp.info/en/"</a
              >
              and pick the free download.
            </p>
            <p>
              They'll want to sell you the paid product but the free one is
              fine.
            </p>
            <p>
              (There is a $1.99 version in the Mac App store, if you want to go
              that route. That'll work equally well for Mac users, and might be
              less hassle.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Once the installation is complete, you&rsquo;ll find two folders
              in your Applications (Mac) or Programs (Windows) folder &mdash;
              one for MAMP, and another that is a 14-day free trial for MAMP
              Pro. Open the folder named MAMP and launch the MAMP app.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              When you install MAMP, it sets the default Document Root folder on
              your computer. You can change this by going to the Web Server tab
              and clicking Select. Change the default Document Root for your
              MAMP website files by clicking the Select button and browsing to
              wherever you're storing your files for BIT 112.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Click the &ldquo;Start Servers&rdquo; button in MAMP. That should
              start the web server and load your index.html page, and all the
              includes and links should work the same as they will on
              <i>github.io</i>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Change code, save it, reload the page in the browser, and things
              should all work.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Holy $#&amp;%, you just installed a working web server! Tell your
              boss you deserve a raise, update your resume and LinkedIn page,
              and show all your teachers the genius certificate you will
              automatically get sent from Elon Musk.
            </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
              <em
                >Genius certificate not guaranteed. Or even likely. But you do
                deserve it.</em

        <h3>Caveats</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              This is so far beyond what I'm supposed to be teaching in this
              class that it's surreal. You are not obligated to do this.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              That also means I am not obligated to make it work. :-) I'll help
              as best I can.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Remember to save your code before you reload the page.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If you don't see your changes, you might need to empty your
              browser cache (temporary Internet files)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              You still have to upload your code to GitHub if you want me to be
              able to help you with it.
