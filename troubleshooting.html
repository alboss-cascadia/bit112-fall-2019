        <h2>Make sure file extensions are visible</h2>
        <p>
          Unless you’ve forced it to behave, your operating system is lying to
          you. It's not showing you the complete filenames. This will drive you
          crazy in a web or programming class.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, both Windows and MacOS are set up to hide the
          <em>extension</em>, the dot and the letters at the end of the file
          name.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you haven't already done this, change the default on your computer
          so you can see complete filenames including the “extension,” the dot
          and the letters at the end of the file name.
        </p>

            Linux assumes you are competent and doesn't hide the file extensions
            from you by default. Linux wins this round.

        <p>
          The two smartest things you can do when troubleshooting and getting
          nowhere are:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Take a break, and/or</li>
          <li>Ask someone else to look at it</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          I am not great at remembering to do either of those. Next thing I
          know, my head hurts, it&rsquo;s 4pm and I forgot to eat lunch, and
          I&rsquo;m halfway through shaving a yak.&nbsp;(Reference:&nbsp;<a

        <h2>Cache</h2>
        <p>
          Bowsers store a temporary copy, or cache, of pages you've visited
          recently. They're supposed to replace the copy when the page changes,
          but it doesn't always work. So, any time you're not seeing a change
          you know you made, it might be your web browser playing tricks on you.
          Here are instructions for most browsers:
        </p>

        <h2>Console error messages</h2>
        <p>
          All the browsers handle errors differently. Most of them will
          highlight where they think the problem is, but it's still algorithms
          and artificial intelligence and sometimes they get it wrong.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p>&lt;h1&gt;Heading</p>
        <p>&lt;p&gt;Blah blah blah&lt;/p&gt;</p>
        <p>
          Will usually return an error saying the &lt;p&gt; is misplaced because
          it's inside a heading. The actual error is that I forgot the closing
          &lt;/h1&gt;.
        </p>
        <p>
          &lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="page.html"&gt;link will be a
          problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
          The error message will probably say something like there's a closing
          &lt;/a&gt; that doesn't match anything. The problem is that my nesting
          is off; I needed to &lt;/a&gt; before I &lt;/p&gt;.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, even when it says there's an error, sometimes the clue it gives
          you isn't quite right.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can open a page from your computer in a web browser and use the
          inspector on that. We aren't doing anything that will only work on a
          server. Any of the browsers can open a file from your computer, and
          their inspector consoles will work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, if you would like someone else in the class (including me)
          to help figure something out, the code needs to be in GitHub unless
          one of us is sitting at your computer with you. And, even once it's
          working on your computer, it needs a final check on the server just to
          make sure it works there as well. Sometimes things work on your
          computer but not on the server. It doesn't happen often, but when it
          does happen it's inconvenient.

        <h2>How does the <i>em</i> or <i>rem</i> work?</h2>
        <p>
          An em is the width of the widest character in the charset, which in
          our alphabet is the <strong>M</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don't specify any absolute values (px, pt, in, etc.) then it
          will work off the defaults that are set in the browser. This is
          awesome for accessibility because it means if I have set my base font
          size to be 24px instead of 14px, the headings will resize in
          proportion to my default, rather than whatever arbitrary size some
          designer picked that's always way too small for me to see.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is terrible for designers because they don't like giving that
          much control to users. They set the design to work within certain
          constraints, and if people override those constraints you get
          unexpected results, like text that is bigger than the box that is
          supposed to contain it, or things that don't print out right, or
          buttons that don't line up with their labels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usability/accessibility people and designers should never date. It
          doesn't end well.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make the math easy in my example here, I'll say I've set the
          default to be 10px.
        </p>
        <p
          style="font-family: courier, 'courier new', monospace; font-weight: bold"
        >
          html { font-size: 10px }
        </p>
        <p>Therefore 1em is 10px.</p>
        <p>
          Here's where it gets tricky. With rem, I set the default for the html
          element to 10px and everything will be relative to that. The rem is
          always based on the root element of the document, which is the html
          element. So if I say
        </p>
        <p
          style="font-family: courier, 'courier new', monospace; font-weight: bold"
        >
          h1 { font-size: 3.6rem }
        </p>
        <p>
          that's 3.6 x 10px, or 36px. Rem is super-easy for figuring out
          font-size, and if you change the font-size of the the root element,
          you just changed it for the whole document because it's all
          multiplying off that.
        </p>
        <p>The em is slightly different for one practical reason.</p>
        <p>
          Em inherits from its parent element. It will work exactly like rem
          until you override something. Let's say I set
        </p>
        <p
          style="font-family: courier, 'courier new', monospace; font-weight: bold"
        >
          html { font-size: 10px }<br />
          h1 { font-size: 3.6em }
        </p>
        <p>but then I set</p>
        <p
          style="font-family: courier, 'courier new', monospace; font-weight: bold"
        >
          aside { font-size: 20px }
        </p>
        <p>My html will turn out kind of like this:</p>
        <p
          style="font-family: courier, 'courier new', monospace; font-weight: bold"
        >
          &lt;html&gt;<br />
          &lt;body&gt;<br />
          &lt;h1&gt;36px&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
          &lt;p&gt;10px&lt;/p&gt;<br />
          &lt;aside&gt;<br />
          &lt;h1&gt;72px because it's 3.6x the parent element, which is aside,
          which is 20px&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
          &lt;p&gt;20px&lt;/p&gt;<br />
          &lt;/aside&gt;<br />
          &lt;p&gt;Back to 10px&lt;/p&gt;<br />
          &lt;/body&gt;<br />
          &lt;/html&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a fairly understandable article on this admittedly abstract
          concept, at
          <a
            href="https://j.eremy.net/confused-about-rem-and-em/"

          >. I'm not sure I agree with his conclusion, but his explanations are
          good, and the part called Save Lives with EM is a great example of why
          we use em and rem instead of px.
