      <h2>My home town</h2>
       <div class="bit-columns">
        <p class="intro">I was actually born in Miami, but I must not have liked it since I left when I was only three days old. I was kidnapped by a band of sedentary Midwestern fabric merchants and forced to live in a small town in Missouri. I had to learn to speak English and get a passport before I was allowed to leave Missouri.</p>
