              Sometimes I get to commute by boat.

          <p>When the weather is nice, I will often bicycle to work. And, when my schedule permits, I'll ride to the water taxi dock and take the passenger ferry across Elliot Bay. It's the cheapest therapy you can find.</p>
          <p>Most of the time, I commute to work by bus. The buses run every 15-30 minutes and deliver me within a couple blocks of home and work. Given the amount of traffic in Seattle during commute times, and the expense of parking in downtown Seattle, and the distance I'd have to walk to get from an affordable parking lot to my office, taking the bus only adds about ten minutes to the commute time.</p>
        <p>Sometimes it does feel as if someone hung a sign around my neck that says, <i>Are you certifiably insane? Do you smell like the unwashed hold of an old fishing boat? Have you ever been probed by aliens? Come talk to me! I didn't really want to read my book, anyway.</i> Of course, this means I get lots of good bus stories.</p>

      <section id="pioneer-square"><p>My office is in downtown Seattle, in Pioneer Square. This is the oldest part of the city, and is home to a lot of tech companies and a lot of homeless people. There are a minimum of three Starbucks per block, and an equal number of independent espresso shops. Coffee comes right out of the faucets here.</p>
