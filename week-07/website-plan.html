        <h2>Target audience</h2>

        <p>
          Although <em>Skeleton Residue</em> is best known for performing the
          National Anthem of Fredonia during the World Cup Octofinals, they are
          actually Aruba's most popular punk electro-polka band, with an
          audience that consists heavily of women between 37 and 42 years of
          age, women in their late teens to early twenties, pre-teens of both
          genders, and males who are interested in impressing women between 37
          and 42 years of age, and women in their late teens to early
          twenties--in other words, males.

        <h2>Site purpose</h2>

        <p>
          This website will introduce <em>Skeleton Residue</em> to the handful
          of people who have not already been explosed to their sensuous wooing
          melodies. It will feature legal clips from their songs, as well as
          mashups with <em>Skeleton Residue</em>, <em>Deatht&ouml;ngue</em>and
          <em>The Vomiting Poodles</em>. There will be frequent sales on merch
          and coupons for discounts on fresh fish.

        <h2>Site personality</h2>

        <p>
          This will be a website that enjoys pterodactyls, wizards, cheese, and
          long walks to the kitchen to find cheese.
        </p>

        <p>
          This website will be like a long walk on the beach with your lover,
          until the LSD wears off and you realize you're just dragging a stolen
          mannequin around a Wendy's parking lot.
        </p>

        <p>
          At museums, this website would be allowed to touch the art. It could
          play a game of Russian Roulette with a fully loaded semiautomatic
          pistol, and win. Mosquitos will refuse to bite it, purely out of
          respect.

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              For certain followers of <em>Skeleton Residue</em>, anything
              mechanical that they encounter refuses to work correctly. This
              could simply be mildly (-5) annoying &ndash; fuses that blow,
              constant static on the telephone line, or a VCR that eats the tape
              the <strong>very large</strong> neighbor loaned them. It could be
              a bit more (-10) serious &ndash; the electric sliding doors to the
              emergency room refuse to open for them, their car dies in the fast
              lane of a major freeway during rush hour, or they crash a world
              information network <strong>every</strong>> time they log on. Or
              it could reach catastrophic (-15) proportions &ndash; the entire
              city's phone bills are routed to their cell number, the IRS
              computer has messed their taxes up so often the local auditor now
              sends them birthday and Christmas cards, or they simply cause a
              two-square-block power outage wherever they go.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Spontaneous human combustion is a concern with followers of this
              band. If they are alone and sitting quietly, they have been known
              to burst into flames. If somebody comes into the room they can put
              them out by rolling them on the floor.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Some of this band's fans are dead. Finis. Kaput. Pushing up
              daisies. Gone to join the Choir Invisible. All attributes and
              skills are 0, except for odor, which is worse. They just lie there
              and rot. Their Appearance goes down by 1 every month unless they
              have been mummified or frozen.
